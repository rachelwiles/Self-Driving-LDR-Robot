# Self Driving LDR Robot :bulb: :car:
## Using LDR input to design an autonomous robot that moves towards a light source in Arduino

This project was successful in using a microcontroller to build, code and test a selfdriving robot, driving towards a light source. By assembling multiple LDRs around the robot and recording the intensity of light, the code created establishes the direction of the light source and turns and drives the robot in this direction. The responsiveness of the robot means itâ€™s suitable for a moving light, adapting to endless changes with positioning of target light source.
